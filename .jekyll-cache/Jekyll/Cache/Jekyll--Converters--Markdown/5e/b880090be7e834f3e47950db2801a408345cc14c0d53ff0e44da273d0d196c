I"m<p>I’ve always wanted to setup a blog.</p>

<p>And now, it is done when I’m over 30.</p>

<p>Just kidding. I’ve setup blog via different platforms in Chinese these years.</p>

<p>This one is my new love.</p>

<p>I plan to use this blog to practice my English writing skill, record my side projects and share my thought of coding and reading.</p>
