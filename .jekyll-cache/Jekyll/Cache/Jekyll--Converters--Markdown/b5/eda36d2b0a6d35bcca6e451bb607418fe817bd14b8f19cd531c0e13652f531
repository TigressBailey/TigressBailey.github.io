I"ö<p>Major news, everyone.</p>

<p>After using Ember about one and half year, I released my very first ember addon: <a href="https://github.com/tigressbailey/ember-cli-page-progress">ember-cli-page-progress</a>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s such a pleasant journey these years. Iâ€™ve learned solid techniques with some soft skills.
To contribute the community, that feels good.</p>

<p>Keep code simple, beautiful and readable are my lines. I consider this addon as a handy tool and the code has good readability.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll continue this as lots of things can inspire me all the time.</p>

<p>Please feel free to try it at <a href="https://tigressbailey.github.io/ember-cli-page-progress/">https://tigressbailey.github.io/ember-cli-page-progress/</a></p>
